##Singlebrook mock up

Singlebrook Technology Inc has just hired you to build their webpage.  After speaking with their User Experience Design Team you are given a photo of what they want the page to look like.  Using Bootstrap, or another CSS framework of your choice, write the code for their webpage and make it look as close as possible to their mock up. 
  1. Download the starter code from repo.
  2. Open the mockup.png file and take note of the layout and structure of the page.
  3. Create the HTML and CSS files and begin coding!
    * **They have provided the images for you to use.**
    * **The color code for the turquoise they want you to use is 00d6dd**

## Bonus

Singlebrook has now requested that their site be responsive so that they have a good looking mobile site as well.  They are leaving it up to you to decide how the mobile design will layout. Using bootstrap and/or media queries build a responsive site that that is optimized for both mobile and desktop.
