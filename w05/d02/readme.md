# Rails!

## Part 1 - Getting Started with Rails
- Read the chapter ["Getting Started with Rails"](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) in the Rails Guide. You DON'T need to actually follow along and run the code in their examples, although you're welcome to if you'd like to. The Rails Guide is a "plain English" mini-book of how Rails works and how to use it. It's a fantastic resource for learning pretty much anything you want to learn about Rails.

## Part 2 - Rails for Zombies
- Complete the [Rails for Zombies](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-redux) Code School course. It provides a great intro and practice for working with Rails. You don't need to submit a screenshot of your progress, this will be an "honor code" submission - but I promise you will want to complete it!
