# User Auth Review

This is a review of the last couple of lessons.

- Read [Chapter 6](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/modeling_users#cha-modeling_users) about modeling users and user auth in The Ruby on Rails Tutorial.
- Read [Chapter 11](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/user_microposts) about modeling posts in The Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## Bonus
This is an interesting chapter on how to craft a many to many relationship
- Read [Chapter 12](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/following_users) about how to add following and followed by for users

## SUPER Bonus
- Try adding [Sorcery](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery) or [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) to the pizza_places app so we can log users in and out.
    - Sorcery is not as 'magic' as Devise - it requires you to write more code yourself. However, its advantage is that it is easily customizable and easy to understand. Devise, on the other hand, does nearly everything for you on the authentication front, but can tough to understand and difficult to customize. Choose wisely...
