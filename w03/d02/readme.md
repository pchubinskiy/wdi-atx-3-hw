## Project Requirements Gathering

Tonight, you're going to start planning out your Tic Tac Toe project. You will submit this as a Github issue on the homework repository. If you're unsure of how to create a Github issue... Google it.

**1)** The first element of building any project is **requirements gathering**. Think about what features the    **MVP** of your product will need to contain, and write them down. Remember, each requirement should be an "atomic unit" of a fully shippable feature, such as:

`A user can click on a space on the Tic Tac Toe board to select their move.`

Not something as broad as

`Users can play Tic Tac Toe`

Please submit a list of the requirements you think your app will need as a text document for homework.

**This may be a good time for trello or pivitol tracker**

  **2)** You'll also want some wireframes of what your app should look like. These are just basic drawings (by hand or using an app like [Gliffy](https://www.gliffy.com/) or something similar). You'll want at least one wireframe, but possibly more if your game has many different UI elements you want to represent in different views (for example, a "New Game" modal that allows users to enter their names and start a new game should be different from the actual gameplay wireframe).

Submit images or links to the wireframes as necessary as part of the Github issue.
