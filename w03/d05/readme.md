## Double Bonus: Codewars Challenge!!!

Lets test our skills on codewars and continue to challenge our ever growing programming knowledge.  Over the break we are going to have a contest for who ever does the most code wars challenges!  The winner will receive a prize later on in the course (*A PackStack t-shirt signed by CEO Mike Dang is worth at least $80,000 on the dark web.*)  You do not have to complete the challenges to get credit, however, you do have to make a legitimate attempt to solve the problem.  Here are the rules and submission process:

- Student must find a challenge on codewars.com to attempt to solve.
- Student must then copy the challenge question and put it into a readme file.
- Student will then create a separate JS file where they will place their JS code. (Show your code regardless of if it is correct or not.  As long as there was a valid attempt you will get credit.)
- Add the file into your codewars directory in the HW repo.
- Push your changes up to github and create a pull request.
- All Submissions must be made by Wednesday January 6th in order to count for the contest.
