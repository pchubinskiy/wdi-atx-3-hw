## Calculator part duex

In our last lab we created a calculator that would give the output of certain mathematical operations and log them onto the page. However, if you refresh the page all of your results will disappear!  Using what we learned today about local storage, get your log to persist even if the page is refreshed or closed and reloaded.

##Bonus

  - Time to refactor your code.  Take a look at your calculator and see if there are some things that you can refactor.  Look and see if you are consistently repeating yourself, maybe there is a way to make your code more DRY and modular.
