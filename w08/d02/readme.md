# Ultimate Complimenter!

Create an app to text yourself compliments, courtesy of the Twilio API!

- First, sign up for a developer account at https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
- Then, register a phone number with Twilio at https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming
- Then, verify your own phone number with Twilio at https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/verified
- Use your Account SID and Account Secret to create an awesome app that texts you a random compliment when you submit a form!

There is an express app created for you in the starter folder.  There is a simple form for you to use with two fields, to and message.  In routes/index.js is where you will be putting most of your code to get this to work. (Remember we should probably store our credentials somewhere else!)  

Use the information provided by the [Twilio API Explorer](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/dev-tools/api-explorer/incoming-create).  It might be worth while to check out the messages endpoint ***hint hint***.  If your having any issues build an app that can let you text someone.  Then text Mike Dang at 512-762-5166 informing him that you cant get your texting app to work!

Continue to explore the Twilio API and see what other features you can incorporate.  Or if you're feeling really dangerous try and integrate another API to add to the text functionality of the Twilio API
