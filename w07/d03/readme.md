# WDI Emergency Compliment


## Missionâ€¦

Create your own version of [Emergency Compliment](http://emergencycompliment.com/), except making the compliments WDI-themed. When a user visits the site, they should be greeted with a WDI-themed compliment to cheer them up.  If you have any trouble deciding on where to begin, remember [Mike's walkthrough] (https://gist.github.com/mdang/0a8e00883b2e25424e05#file-express_app_walkthrough-md).

## Level 1: generic compliment

When you visit the root (`"/"`) of your app, it should display a generic greeting and a randomly chosen compliment. The background color of the app should be randomized as well.

Here are some sample compliments and colors (feel free to substitute in your own):

```js
compliments = [
"Your instructors love you",
"High five = ^5",
"Is it Ruby Tuesday yet?",
"It's almost beer o'clock",
"The Force is strong with you"
];

colors = ["#FFBF00", "#0080FF","#01DF3A","#FF0080"];
```

Put your greeting & compliment each in a container element with a class of `.compliment` to take advantage of the provided styles.

## Level 2: personalized compliment

When you visit `"/name"` (ie: `"/randy"`), the greeting should personalize itself to the provided name. There should still be a random compliment and background color.

## Bonus: User submitted compliments

Allow a user to add to the list of compliments using a POST request. You can submit POST requests to the app.
