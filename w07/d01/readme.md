# JS Reintroduction

## Part 1
- Continue working on whichever JavaScript assignment you worked on during class. Submit that as your homework in the appropriate HW folder (w07d01) on a branch of the same name, as usual. If you finished the assignment you worked on in class today, then pick one of the others from the class repo for today (Pixart or The Walker) and work on that for homework.

## Part 2
- Read Chapter 6 of Eloquent Javascript, [The Secret Life of Objects](http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html). In this unit, will be using the principles of Object Oriented Programming that we learned in Ruby and bringing them to JavaScript, and we'll need to know how to use Objects in JavaScript more deftly to do so.
