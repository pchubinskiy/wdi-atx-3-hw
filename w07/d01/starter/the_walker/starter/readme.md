## The Walker
In the `index.html` file lives a friendly captive .gif known only as *The Walker*. At present, The Walker only knows how to walk in place, but he has hired us to imbue him with more dynamic behavior. His specifications are below.

#### Client Specs
* By default, The Walker would like to start at the right border and walk left.
* When The Walker crosses the threshold of either border, he would like to turn around.

#### Bonus Spec
* When clicked, The Walker would like to change direction.
